# Denton Kiosk Design Plan

## About

We (TechMill Denton) are building a web application that aggregates useful information to Denton residents and newcomers visiting our community. This app will initially be live on an iPad in a moderate-traffic public space while we perform beta testing with users, and eventually housed permanently in a large, rigid enclosure right on the square.

Our community is extremely active and oftentimes there are many events happening concurrently, but thereâ€™s not a single resource which aggregates all of that data.

## Resources

- Real-time DCTA information
  _ Train and bus stops
  _ Current location \* Prices/plans

- Environmental data
  _ Weather
  _ Air quality

- Community events (Calendar)
  _ Community market
  _ Upcoming concerts and meet-ups
  _ Aggregate from social media
  _ City event calendar

- Facts
  _ Recycling
  _ Green energy availability
  _ Cost of living, density, crime statistics
  _ Historical factoids

- Local news \* Denton record-chronicle

## Data collection

Another key purpose of this application is its data collection capabilities.

- User engagement by page (social services, events, local retail, etc).
- Event tracking (interacting with transit feed, weather, or ads).
- Data from surveys directly in the kiosk.
